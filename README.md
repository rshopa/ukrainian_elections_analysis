# Analysis of Ukrainian Elections in 2004-2015 

This is an independent project devoted to detection and analysis of vote manipulation during President elections in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014. For comparison, election results from other countries (Canada and Poland) were used in order to determine symptoms of fraud 
and vote manipulation.

The tools used in this project include Web scraping techniques using Ruby, data analysis in R and data visualization (R or Tableau, not set yet).
